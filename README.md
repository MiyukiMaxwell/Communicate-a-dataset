Project Overview
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.

In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, I used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, 
starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.
Through this exploration I told a story and each step was clearly explained with graph analysis also. 

In Part II, Explanatory data visualization,I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties,
trends, and relationships discovered in the PISA dataset. 
Part II is the polished, explanatory visualization.


Why this project?
Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process.

After completing this project, I can:

Supplement statistics with visualizations to build an understanding of data.
Choose appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset, 
allowing you to understand distributions of variables and relationships between features.
Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.
